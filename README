## Release 1
At Dev Bootcamp we take a test-driven approach to development. Before we write code, we're going to write tests that will tell us if the code we do write is operating the way that we expect it to.

Write tests for the next methods:


* Define a recursive function that returns true if a string is a palindrome and false otherwise.



* Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and prints "n bottles of beer on the wall", "(n-1) bottles of beer on the wall", ..., "no more bottles of beer on the wall".



* Define a recursive function that flattens an array. The method should convert [[1, 2], [3, 4]] to [1, 2, 3, 4] and [[1, [8, 9]], [3, 4]] to [1, 8, 9, 3, 4].

## Release 2

Base on the tests implement method
